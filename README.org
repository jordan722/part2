CSCI 136 - Lab 8

Code has several files for each part of the lab, which were named and made well enough to make sense to another person.

Has two main functions 
Has double declarations of variables

Apple to Linux code switch was an obstacle (TToTT) since function runs properly on his system, but not mine!

Indent.cpp code works \(^o^)/
I like that it can read another actual program and not an assumed textfile or something.
